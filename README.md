## What is This?

I figured I should try putting things in the RIO monad and playing around with application architecture. That's what this repo is for.

## Execute  

* Run `stack exec -- whatShouldIDraw-exe` to cache some HTTP requests to local files
* With `stack exec -- whatShouldIDraw-exe --verbose` for more logging

## Run tests

`stack test`
